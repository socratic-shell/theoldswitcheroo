OpenVSCode Server provides robust extension management through `--install-extension` flags that support marketplace IDs, local .vsix files, and remote URLs. Each multiplexer taskspace requires isolated `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir` directories for complete separation. Extensions can be pre-installed at runtime (not during Docker builds due to missing IPC hooks), and custom .vsix files work seamlessly alongside marketplace extensions when deployed to each taskspace's isolated extension directory.
