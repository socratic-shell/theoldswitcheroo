# Comprehensive VSCode server cleanup strategies for SSH disconnection

Your VSCode server cleanup challenges stem from a fundamental issue: processes spawned during SSH sessions don't automatically terminate when the SSH connection drops, regardless of disconnection type. After extensive research, I've identified multiple robust server-side solutions that ensure complete cleanup without relying on client cooperation.

## The most effective approach combines built-in flags with system-level monitoring

The simplest starting point is enabling VSCode's built-in automatic shutdown mechanism using the **`--enable-remote-auto-shutdown`** flag. This flag triggers server termination 5 minutes after the last connection closes. However, since this alone isn't always sufficient, you'll want to layer it with system-level solutions. The most reliable combination uses systemd user services with cgroup tracking, which ensures all child processes are terminated when your SSH session ends.

Here's a production-ready implementation combining these approaches:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vscode-server-managed.sh - Comprehensive VSCode server management

# Start VSCode with auto-shutdown enabled
/home/user/.vscode-server/bin/*/node \
  /home/user/.vscode-server/bin/*/out/server-main.js \
  --start-server \
  --host=127.0.0.1 \
  --accept-server-license-terms \
  --enable-remote-auto-shutdown \
  --port=0 &

VSCODE_PID=$!

# Monitor parent SSH process
PARENT_SSH_PID=$(ps -o ppid= -p $$ | tr -d ' ')
while kill -0 $PARENT_SSH_PID 2>/dev/null; do
    sleep 10
done

# SSH disconnected - kill entire process group
kill -TERM -$VSCODE_PID 2>/dev/null
sleep 5
kill -KILL -$VSCODE_PID 2>/dev/null
pkill -u $USER -f "vscode-server"
```

## Systemd provides the strongest guarantees for process cleanup

For maximum reliability, implement a systemd user service with proper session binding. This approach leverages systemd's cgroup tracking to ensure **all** child processes are terminated when the session ends, regardless of how they were spawned.

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/vscode-server.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=VSCode Server with Session Management
After=graphical-session.target
BindsTo=graphical-session.target
PartOf=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/code tunnel --accept-server-license-terms
KillMode=cgroup
KillSignal=SIGTERM
TimeoutStopSec=30
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

The **`KillMode=cgroup`** directive is crucial - it ensures systemd kills all processes in the control group, not just the main process. This solves your problem of orphaned extensionHost and ptyHost processes.

## SSH-specific monitoring detects all disconnection scenarios

Configure SSH daemon settings for reliable disconnection detection by adding these lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 3
TCPKeepAlive yes
```

These settings make the SSH server send keepalive messages every 15 seconds and disconnect after 3 unanswered messages (45 seconds total). This handles network failures effectively.

For immediate cleanup on disconnection, implement a PAM session hook by adding to `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:

```
session optional pam_exec.so /usr/local/bin/vscode-cleanup.sh
```

With the cleanup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/vscode-cleanup.sh

if [ "$PAM_TYPE" = "close_session" ]; then
    echo "$(date): Cleaning VSCode for $PAM_USER" >> /var/log/vscode-cleanup.log
    
    # Kill all VSCode processes for this user
    pkill -u "$PAM_USER" -f "vscode-server"
    pkill -u "$PAM_USER" -f "remoteExtensionHostAgent"
    
    # Clean up server directories
    find /home/"$PAM_USER"/.vscode-server/bin -name "*.pid" -delete 2>/dev/null
fi
```

## Process supervision tools excel at managing complex child processes

If systemd isn't available or you need more control, Supervisor provides excellent process management with automatic child cleanup. Configure `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/vscode-server.conf`:

```ini
[program:vscode-server]
command=/usr/bin/code tunnel --accept-server-license-terms
directory=/home/user
user=user
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
stopsignal=TERM
stopwaitsecs=30
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/vscode-server.log
```

The **`stopasgroup=true`** and **`killasgroup=true`** directives ensure all child processes are terminated together - exactly what you need for VSCode's multi-process architecture.

## Container isolation guarantees complete cleanup

For the ultimate in process isolation and cleanup, run VSCode server in a container with automatic removal:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    --name vscode-server \
    -v $(pwd):/workspace \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    --init \
    mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20 \
    code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 /workspace
```

The **`--rm`** flag ensures the container and all its processes are removed when the main process exits. The **`--init`** flag adds a proper init process for signal handling. This approach has minimal performance overhead (2-5% CPU) while providing complete isolation.

For lighter-weight isolation without Docker, use Linux namespaces directly:

```bash
unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc bash -c '
    code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 /workspace &
    VSCODE_PID=$!
    
    trap "kill -TERM -$VSCODE_PID" EXIT
    wait $VSCODE_PID
'
```

## Session-based cleanup using TTY detection works across distributions

Monitor TTY status to detect disconnections and trigger cleanup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tty-monitor.sh

TTY_DEVICE="/dev/$(tty | cut -d'/' -f3-)"

monitor_tty() {
    while [ -c "$TTY_DEVICE" ] && fuser "$TTY_DEVICE" >/dev/null 2>&1; do
        sleep 5
    done
    
    echo "TTY disconnected, cleaning up VSCode..."
    pkill -u $(whoami) -f "vscode-server"
}

monitor_tty &
code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080
```

For systems with systemd-logind, leverage session tracking:

```bash
SESSION_ID=$(loginctl list-sessions --no-legend | grep $(whoami) | awk '{print $1}' | head -1)

monitor_session() {
    while loginctl show-session "$SESSION_ID" >/dev/null 2>&1; do
        STATE=$(loginctl show-session "$SESSION_ID" -p State --value)
        if [ "$STATE" = "closing" ]; then
            pkill -f "vscode-server"
            break
        fi
        sleep 10
    done
}
```

## Implementation recommendations based on your environment

**For development environments**, combine VSCode's `--enable-remote-auto-shutdown` flag with a simple wrapper script that monitors the parent SSH process. This provides adequate cleanup with minimal complexity.

**For production servers**, implement the systemd user service with cgroup tracking. This ensures complete cleanup regardless of how processes are spawned or how the SSH connection terminates. Add PAM hooks as a secondary mechanism for immediate cleanup on session close.

**For shared systems**, use container isolation (Docker or Podman rootless) to guarantee complete cleanup and prevent interference between users. The performance overhead is negligible for most workloads.

**For high-security environments**, combine multiple layers: systemd services for lifecycle management, PAM hooks for session cleanup, and cgroups for resource limits and guaranteed termination.

## Performance and complexity tradeoffs

The solutions range from simple (built-in flags) to complex (container orchestration), with corresponding tradeoffs:

- **Built-in flags**: Zero overhead, limited reliability
- **Process monitoring scripts**: Minimal overhead, good reliability
- **Systemd/Supervisor**: Near-zero overhead, excellent reliability
- **PAM hooks**: System-level integration, very high reliability
- **Containers**: 2-5% overhead, complete isolation and cleanup

## Critical implementation details for success

Regardless of which approach you choose, ensure these critical elements:

1. **Always use process groups** (`kill -TERM -$PID`) rather than individual process killing
2. **Implement graceful shutdown** with SIGTERM before SIGKILL
3. **Clean up filesystem artifacts** (`.pid` files, sockets) to prevent issues on restart
4. **Set appropriate timeouts** (30-60 seconds) for graceful shutdown before force-killing
5. **Log cleanup activities** for debugging persistent process issues

The most common mistake is relying solely on signal traps or client-side cleanup. Server-side monitoring with system-level integration (systemd, PAM, or containers) provides the reliability you need for production environments. Start with the systemd approach if available, as it offers the best balance of reliability, performance, and simplicity.
